# Abstractüí°

The aim of our project is to create a student portal which works as an interface and used to associate with the students in a university. Here the portal is basically classified into two categories such as Registration Desk and Community Portal . Here the application permits the enrolled user to login and new user is allowed to enroll. Student community portal contains forums including Event queries , Placement queries , Sports queries , Freshers queries etc.

# Problem Statementüìò

When it comes to college there are freshers that are concerned about the event's queries, placement's queries , faculty reviews , holidays and queries about their courses etc. Our website will help these type of students to interact with other students to help solve their queries. More functionalities and features will be added to make it easier and convenience for students to get their question answered. This website can be one stop solution to all the problems of the students.

# Reason To Choose this topicüìà

* The major reason behind choosing this topicis to help students who are shy asking their queries in person can ask their queries here regarding different events in the college and interact with the seniors to make connection and all in the college.
* The another reason for choosing this topic is to provide ease to the students, with this they can know the college and the other students.
* Providing interactive and improved user interface can help the student to use our website more effectively for their own benefits.
